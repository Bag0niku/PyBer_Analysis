# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
Analysis of ride-sharing data to showcase the drivers, riders, and fare by city type. The trends and visualizations are to inform decisions that improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

### Resources:
 - Data: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv
 - Software: Python 3.7.13, Pandas 1.3.5, Numpy 1.21.5, matplotlib 3.5.1, jupyter notebook (notebook server 6.4.8, Ipython 7.31.1)


## Summary 
The data includes:
 - 120 Cities, 2375 Rides, date & time of each ride, cost of the ride(fare), the unique ride id's, total drivers per city and no null/NaN values.
 - I  will be visualizing the cities by city type because There are too many cities to visualize together and maintain their sense of being unique. 

## Results:

## Challenge Background
Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, youâ€™ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
